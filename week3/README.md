### This document outlines the contents of week 3

'week3' contains four directories namely 'code', 'data', 'results, 'sandbox'. This week is based on R and all the scripts are written in RStudio

#### Code
This directory contains all R scripts and files containing code that are required for submission. All the scripts have to be called using this directory as the present working directory. The following is a short description of the files present in this directory:

* basic_io.R: A basic R script illustrating reading and writing files using R. In class script. 
* control_flow.R: R script showing various control flow methods in R. In class script. 
* next.R: Using the 'next' function. In class script.
* break.R: Using 'break' function in while loop. In class script. 
* boilerplate.R: A boilerplate function showing arguements. In class script. 
* R_conditionals.R: A script creating basic conditional functions. In class script.
* TreeHeight.R: Using a input .csv file to calculate the heights of trees given in the file and saving the output as TreeHts.csv. 
* Vectorize1.R: Comapring running time differences for loops and vectorized functions with and without preallocation. In class script.
* preallocate.R: Comparing run time differences with and without preallocation. In class script.
* apply1.R: Using the 'apply' function in R. In class script.
* apply2.R: Using the 'apply' function across a matrix. In class script.
* sample.R: Creating a random population and then carrying out operations loopy way with and without preallocation. In class script.
* Ricker.R: R script simulating growth using the Rickcer model. In class script.
* Vectorize2.R: R script doing a stochastic simulatio of the Ricker model with and without vectorization and comparing the time.
* browse.R: A script illustrating the use of 'browse' function in R. In class script.
* try.R: A script using the 'try' and 'doit' functions in R. In class script.
* Florida.R: A simple code to check if Florida is getting warmer. It also has a mini-report written in LaTeX and PDF output of it.
* Florida_Latex.tex: A LaTeX file for reporting the results.
* DataWrang.R: Wrangling data using base R and then converting it to tibble. In class script.
* DataWrangTidy.R: Repeating the DataWrang.R using tidyverse.
* PP_Dist.R: Plotting predator and prey mass distribution by Type of feeding interaction using base R plots. Also, saving the mean and median of the distributions as a .csv file
* PP_Regress.R: Plotting Predator and prey mass relationship using ggplot and also saving the regression results as a .csv file. 
* GPDD_Data.R: Superimposing species distribution on the world map in R.
* Girko.R: Creating a visulization of Girko's circular law. In class script.
* MyBars.R: Annotating a plot using ggplot. In class script.
* plotLin.R: Using ggplot to plot and annotate a liner regression. In class script. 
* SQLinR.R: Very basic SQL script in R. 

The follwing packages are required to run the script:
* tidyverse
* maps
* reshape2
* sqldf

Please be sure to install them in your R environment to run the scripts without errors. 

#### Data
This directory has all the data required by the scripts. It also contains the images used for the Florida_results.tex 

#### Results
This directory id empty presently. After running all the scripts it is expected to contain the results given by the scripts.

#### Sandbox
This directory is for practice and contains practice scripts and files. On GitHub it is empty as it is not meant for submission.
