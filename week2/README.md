## Week 2

### This docments outlines the contents of week 2

'week2' contains four directories namely 'code', 'data', 'results, 'sandbox'.

#### Code
This directory contains all python scripts and files containing code that are required for submission. All the scripts have to be called using this directory as the present working directory. The following is a short description of the files present in this directory:

* align_seqs.py: It is a python program which aligns two given sequences. The sequences are hardcoded in the program.
* basic_csv.py: This script gives an example on how to read and write .csv files.
* basic_io1.py: This script gives and example on how to read a .txt file.
* basic_io2.py:  This script gives an example on how to write a .txt file.
* baic_io3.py: This script gives an example on how to read and write binary files.
* boilerplate.py: This file illustrstes the basic syntax for writing a python program. It needs no input.
* cfexercies1.py: This file illustrstes basic of writing a module in python.
* cfexercies2.py: This script has basic functions in it. It cannot be called as a program.
* control_flow.py: This program shows how the control flow happens in python.
* debugme.py: This python script shows the basics of debugging in python.
* dictionary.py: This file converts a list of tuples to a dictionary in various ways.
* lc1.py: This script illustrates basics of list comprehension.
* lc2.py: This script uses conditional list comprehension to separate the data.
* loops.py: This script outlines the usage of loops in python.
* MyExampleScript.py: Contains an example function.
* oaks_debufme.py: This program separates the oaks from a list of tree species.
* oaks.py: This script also separates the oaks from a list of tree species.
* scope.py: This file illustrates variable scope. It will run with an error.
* sysargv.py: This file shows the use and application of system arguements.
* test_control_flow.py: This file uses doctests to test a section of a program.
* tuple.py: This script shows how to navigate through tuples.
* using_name.py: It is a basic program in python usesd to show the difference between importing a program and running it independently.

The following groupwork files are also present in this folder:

* align_seq_fasta.py - Script to align two sequences after taking an input from user. It outputs one one best alignment in .csv format. If no input is provided it will run with defaults.

* align_seq_better.py - Script to align two sequences after taking an input from user. It saves all the best alignments in binary format. If no input is provided the script will run with default arguements. 

* oaks_debugme_groupwork.py - This script checks whether the TestOaksData.csv input file contains a header, prints tree species and saves only the oak species. 

The following packages are used in the codes:

* sys - used for taking the input parameter from command line

* csv - used for reading and writing comma separated files

* re - for using regular expressions in python

* pickle - used for reading and writing binary files in python

#### Data
This directory has all the data required by the scripts. 

#### Results
This directory id empty presently. After running all the scripts it is expected to contain the results given by the scripts.

#### Sandbox
This directory is for practice and contains practice scripts and files. On GitHub it is empty as it is not meant for submission.
